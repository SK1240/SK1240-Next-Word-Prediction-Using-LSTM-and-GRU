# 📝 Next Word Prediction using LSTM & GRU
A sleek and educational implementation of **next-word prediction** powered by two advanced **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** architectures — **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**.

This project combines **deep learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** to predict the most likely next word in a given phrase.

It includes **Streamlit**-based **web applications** for **real-time text inference**, **pretrained models**, and interactive training notebooks for further experimentation.
